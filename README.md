# Tree Yourself
Why do you do what you do? What is the engine that keeps you up late at night or gets you going in the morning?

The TreeYourself website allows you to affirm the values and goals you hold dear and visualize them in a beautiful tree.

A 2019 National Bureau of Economic Research [study](https://www.nber.org/digest/dec19/women-persistently-sell-themselves-short-same-skill-men) showed after writing about their own accomplishments and goals woman performed 30 % better in contests. For the challenges in Avanade International Women's Day Hackathon 'Reducing Bias' and Women in Cloud 'Allyship' we can come up with a tree filled by icons that relate to  the answers you gave.
